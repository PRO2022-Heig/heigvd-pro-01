## Broad context

"*What are we eating?*". Everyone has asked himself this question at one point or another. 

- We usually choose what's easiest and are not always satisfied with our choice.
- We often cook the same meals and it is difficult to have a varied and balanced diet.
- It is not always easy to come to an understanding when cooking for a group of people (individual preferences, allergies, ethical concerns, ...).
- Some ingredients are easier to cook and to use with a larger range of recipes, but often tend to be not so healthy (pasta, frozen or precooked meals, ...). This can also have an impact on budget and wasted food.

These problems concern everyone. However, the targeted audience is mainly young adults (18-35) who must cook for themselves and don't have a lot of time to manage it. The application aims to simplify the organization of meals in general. It can typically help in setting up a group meal and can also be used on an everyday basis for personal meals.

Among other things, the application will make it easier to choose meals and select a recipe that suit the users' preferences. It differs from other on-line recipe applications by positioning itself earlier in the process of preparing a meal by helping the user to choose the recipe best suited to the circumstances.

## Application's use cases

### 1. Allergy concerns in meal choices  (required)

#### Context

A young adult, about 30, invites some friends to eat on a Friday night. She wants to cook a nice meal, with a starter, a main course, and a desert. The budget is not a problem, but some of the guests have allergies.

#### Solution

She creates a group in the application and adds all of her guests. The application then suggests some recipes taking into account the allergies of her guests.

### 2. Voting on a group meals (required)

#### Context

A group of friends is planning to cook together. They each have individual preferences and can't reach an understanding over what to cook.

#### Solution

They all join a group and the application suggests a list of possible meals. They can vote on their preferred choice. Once everyone voted, the application shows the results.

### 3. Recipes containing specific ingredients (required)

#### Context

A student is about to meet the parents of her boyfriend for the first time. She wants to impress them with a nice homemade meal. She wants red meet to be the center piece of the main course.

#### Solution

She inputs her criteria and the application suggests recipes with rib eye steaks or beef tenderloin.

### 4. Recipe cooked in a specified amount of time (required)

#### Context

A student doesn't have much time to prepare a lunch. He knows that he has leeks in his fridge that he needs to eat soon. Moreover, he needs a meal that requires about 20 minutes of preparation.

#### Solution

The application will therefore suggest a list of recipes containing leeks and cooked quickly.

### 5. Restaurant suggestion (wished)

#### Context

An employee is in charge of choosing the restaurant for the end-of-the-year office party. He doesn't know the individual preferences of all of his coworkers, but they are all signed up on the platform.

#### Solution

He inputs who will partake and the approximate location where the restaurant should be. The application then suggests a list of restaurants best matching the preferences of his coworkers.

### 6. Shopping list (wished)

#### Context

A recipe has been chosen for a meal between friends. The host must now go and buy all the ingredients ahead of the meal.

#### Solution

The application automatically generates a shopping list based on the recipe and the number of guests.

## Goals

Initially, the application will target students in the context of group meals in a social context, whether it is with close friends or with a larger group of acquaintances. The application should be able to recommend recipes based on the users' profiles and help choose a suitable meal.

In a second phase, the application will focus on adding more sophisticated filtering options, namely being able to choose a recipe containing specified ingredients. This will add flexibility for group choices and help the application be more helpful for personal meals.

In a later phase, more features could be added to the application. An example of such a feature is including restaurants suggestion based on the already existing users' profiles, preferences and filtering options.
